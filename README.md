# RoleBaker

Writing access control is never easy, nor is writing understandable documentation. Trying to navigate through the code, tracing permissions at different points, and figuring out who can do what often turns into a complex and time-consuming task. This library aims to simplify access control management by providing a structured way to define and enforce permissions while also generating clear documentation about role-based access rules.

**RoleBaker** is a flexible library for handling **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)** with type safety in a **framework-agnostic** way. It simplifies managing user permissions and generating automatic documentation, providing a clear and structured approach to handling user roles and resource actions.

## Pros

- **🔒 Type-Safe Access Control** – Prevent runtime errors with strongly typed roles and actions.
- **📚 Auto-Generated Documentation** – Easily generate clear documentation for roles and permissions.
- **🌍 Framework-Agnostic** – Works seamlessly with any JavaScript/TypeScript framework.
- **⚖️ Single & Multi-Role Support** – Supports both single-role users and multi-role configurations.
- **🛡️ Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)** – Define permissions based on roles and dynamic attributes.
- **🔄 Flexible Permission Logic** – Supports both simple boolean checks and complex function-based rules.
