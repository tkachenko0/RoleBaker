#title
Lightweight & Simple Access Control

#description
I’ve spent countless hours digging through code, tracing permissions, and trying to figure out who can do what, only to end up frustrated. That’s why I built this library, to take the guesswork out of access control by providing a structured way to define and enforce permissions while automatically generating clear documentation for role-based rules.

#extra
  ::list
  - **🔒 Type-Safe Access Control** – Prevent runtime errors with strongly typed roles and actions.  
  - **📚 Auto-Generated Documentation** – Easily generate clear documentation for roles and permissions.  
  - **🌍 Framework-Agnostic** – Works seamlessly with any JavaScript/TypeScript framework.  
  - **⚖️ Single & Multi-Role Support** – Supports both single-role users and multi-role configurations.  
  - **🛡️ Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)** – Define permissions based on roles and dynamic attributes.  
  - **🔄 Flexible Permission Logic** – Supports both simple boolean checks and complex function-based rules.
  - **✅ Highly Tested** – Ensures reliability and stability with comprehensive test coverage.
