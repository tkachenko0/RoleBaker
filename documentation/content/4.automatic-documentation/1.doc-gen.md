# Effortless Documentation

Incorporating **role-based access control** (RBAC) in your application is a critical part of securing your resources. However, understanding who has access to what and under what conditions can become complex as the number of roles and resources increases.

With **role-baker**, we simplify the documentation of your **permissions** by generating an automatically structured report. This report can be used to visualize which roles have access to which resources and actions. Furthermore, it also supports **conditional permissions**, where certain permissions depend on dynamic checks.

## Automatic Documentation

The `generatePermissionDocs` function takes care of creating a detailed permission report from your resource configuration. This includes a breakdown of which users can perform specific actions and their corresponding permissions, like:

- **Allowed**: The role is granted access to the action.
- **Denied**: The role is not allowed to perform the action.
- **Conditional**: A dynamic condition must be met for access.

### Example Configuration

```typescript
const { hasPermission, generatePermissionDocs } = bakeAuthorization<
  UserRoles,
  AuthUser,
  MyResourceConfig
>({
  userRoleMode: "singleRole",
  actionDocs: ACTIONS_DOC,
  permissionsConfig: {
    admin: {
      todos: { read: true, write: true, delete: true },
    },
    moderator: {
      todos: { read: true, write: false, delete: false },
    },
    user: {
      todos: {
        read: true,
        write: false,
        delete: {
          checkFunction: (authUser, todo) => todo?.authorId === authUser.userId,
          description: "Only the author can delete their own to-dos",
        },
      },
    },
    betaTester: {
      betaResource: { view: true },
    },
  },
});
```

## Resource Configuration Example

```typescript
export interface MyResourceConfig extends ResourceConfig {
  resources: {
    todos: {
      dataType: ToDoModel;
      action: "read" | "write" | "delete";
    };
    betaResource: {
      dataType: string;
      action: "view";
    };
  };
}

export const ACTIONS_DOC: ActionDescriptionConfig<MyResourceConfig> = {
  todos: {
    read: "Read to-dos",
    write: "Write to-dos",
    delete: "Delete to-dos",
  },
  betaResource: {
    view: "View beta resource",
  },
};
```

### The Resulting Documentation

The `generatePermissionDocs` function returns a **permission documentation report** with the following structure:

```typescript
export type PermissionDocumentationReport = {
  userRoleMode: RoleModeBase;
  report: Record<
    ResourceName,
    Record<ActionName, Record<string, ActionPermissionStatus>>
  >;
  reportHeader: Array<{
    columnName: string;
    isRole: boolean;
  }>;
  reportRows: Array<[string, string, string, ...ActionPermissionStatus[]]>;
};

export type ActionPermissionStatus =
  | "Allowed"
  | "Denied"
  | `Conditional: ${string}`;
```

This report contains the following key components:

- **Report Header**: This defines the structure of the report, identifying the columns and whether they relate to a role.
- **Report Rows**: This provides the actual data about permissions, such as "Allowed", "Denied", or "Conditional" permissions with specific descriptions.

### Example Permission Documentation Report

Given the provided `permissionsConfig` and `ACTIONS_DOC`, the following table can be easley generated:

#### Report Header

| resourceArea | permission | permissionDescription | admin   | moderator | user                                                     | betaTester |
| ------------ | ---------- | --------------------- | ------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| todos        | read       | Read to-dos           | Allowed | Allowed   | Allowed                                                  | Denied     |
| todos        | write      | Write to-dos          | Allowed | Denied    | Denied                                                   | Denied     |
| todos        | delete     | Delete to-dos         | Allowed | Denied    | Conditional: Only the author can delete their own to-dos | Denied     |
| betaResource | view       | View beta resource    | Denied  | Denied    | Denied                                                   | Allowed    |
