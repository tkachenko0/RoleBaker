# Single-Role Scenario

In a **Single-Role Scenario**, each user in your application is assigned one role, and permissions are granted based on that role. This scenario is simpler because the user's role defines their access to resources without involving multiple roles or complex combinations.

## Example Setup

Let's imagine you have a file where the authentication user roles for your application are defined. Here's how that could look:

```typescript
export enum UserRoles {
  Admin = "admin",
  User = "user",
  Moderator = "moderator",
  BetaTester = "betaTester",
}

export interface AuthUser {
  userId: string;
  role: UserRoles;
  // other user properties
}
```

In this example, the `AuthUser` interface defines the authenticated user, including their role which is one of the `UserRoles`.

Next, let's define a resource model, say `ToDoModel`:

```typescript
export type ToDoModel = {
  authorId: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
};
```

Now, let’s consider how we structure the permissions for this model. Here’s how you would organize the access control:

```
access-control
├── permissions.config.ts
└── index.ts
```

In `permissions.config.ts`, you'll define the structure of your permissions for different resources. For instance:

```typescript
// access-control/permissions.config.ts

import { ResourceConfig } from "rolebaker";

export interface MyResourceConfig extends ResourceConfig {
  resources: {
    todos: {
      dataType: ToDoModel;
      action: "read" | "write" | "delete";
    };
    betaResource: {
      dataType: string;
      action: "view";
    };
  };
}
```

Here, `MyResourceConfig` extends `ResourceConfig` and defines two resources: `todos` (representing a to-do list) and `betaResource` (a special resource only for `betaTester` roles). Each resource is associated with actions (like `read`, `write`, `delete` for `todos` or `view` for `betaResource`).

### Assigning Permissions

Now, in `index.ts`, you’ll specify which users can perform which actions on these resources. Here’s how you can configure it:

```typescript
// access-control/index.config.ts
import { MyResourceConfig } from "./permissions.config.ts";
import { bakeAuthorization } from "rolebaker";
import { UserRoles, AuthUser } from "your-auth-file";

export const { hasPermission } = bakeAuthorization<
  UserRoles,
  AuthUser,
  MyResourceConfig
>({
  userRoleMode: "singleRole", // This defines that users can only have one role at a time
  permissionsConfig: {
    admin: {
      todos: { read: true, write: true, delete: true },
    },
    moderator: {
      todos: { read: true, write: false, delete: false },
    },
    user: {
      todos: {
        read: true,
        write: false,
        delete: {
          checkFunction: (authUser, todo) => todo?.authorId === authUser.userId, // Allows a user to delete only their own todo
        },
      },
    },
    betaTester: {
      betaResource: { view: true }, // Only beta testers can view this resource
    },
  },
});
```

### Permissions Configuration

Here’s what’s happening:

- **Admin** can read, write, and delete todos.
- **Moderator** can only read todos and cannot write or delete.
- **User** can only read todos and has restricted delete permissions (they can only delete their own todos).
- **BetaTester** can view the special `betaResource` but has no access to todos.

#### Has Permission?

The `hasPermission` function checks if a user has the right to perform a specific action on a resource. It takes the user, resource, and action as arguments and returns a boolean or evaluates custom logic for permission checks.

```typescript
export const { hashPermission} = bakeAuthorization<...>(...)

// Example
const authorUser: AuthUser = { role: UserRoles.User, userId: "user1" };
const resourceData: ToDoModel = {
    authorId: "user1",
    title: "title",
    description: "description",
};
const isAllowed = hasPermission(authorUser, "todos", "delete", resourceData) // true
```
