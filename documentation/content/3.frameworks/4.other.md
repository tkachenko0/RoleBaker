# Other Frameworks

While **role-baker** does not provide specific utilities for every framework, its core function, `hasPermission`, is all you need to implement role-based access control in various environments.

## Core Function: `hasPermission`

The `hasPermission` function determines whether a user has the necessary permissions for a given resource and action. It can be seamlessly integrated into any framework to restrict access to UI components, API endpoints, middleware, route guards, higher-order components, or other functionalities.

### **Common Integration Approaches**

- **Middleware**: Secure API routes by checking permissions before processing requests.
- **Route Guards**: Prevent unauthorized navigation in frontend frameworks like Angular and Vue.
- **Higher-Order Components (HOCs)**: Wrap UI components to conditionally render content based on user permissions.
- **Direct Conditional Rendering**: Use `hasPermission` inside components or templates to control visibility.

## **Framework-Specific Usage**

Regardless of the framework, you can use `hasPermission` to implement access control efficiently. The following are some common usage patterns:

### **React**

Use `hasPermission` inside components to conditionally render UI elements or wrap them in Higher-Order Components.

### **Angular**

Implement `hasPermission` in route guards to restrict navigation or use directives for conditional rendering.

### **Vue.js**

Utilize `hasPermission` in computed properties or within Vue directives like `v-if` to control access dynamically.

### **Svelte**

Leverage `hasPermission` inside templates to show or hide elements based on user roles.

### **Backend Frameworks (Node.js)**

Apply `hasPermission` in API endpoints, middleware, or controller logic to restrict access based on user roles.
