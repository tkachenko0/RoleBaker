# React

While **role-baker** doesn’t provide specific utilities for frameworks like React, it delivers the most important functionality through the `hasPermission` function. This function checks whether a user has the necessary permissions for a particular resource and action, and it can be easily integrated into React to provide permission-based rendering and route protection.

In React, we can leverage this function by creating custom utilities like **HOCs (Higher-Order Components)** and **Route Guards**. These utilities enable developers to implement permission-based rendering and navigation, ensuring that users can only access certain content or routes based on their roles.

## 1. **Permission HOC (Higher-Order Component)** for Access Control

A **Higher-Order Component (HOC)** can be used to conditionally render components based on the user’s permissions. It allows for more flexible permission checks and can wrap any component to control its visibility.

### Permission HOC

```typescript
import React, { ReactNode, useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { useSelector } from "react-redux";
import { RootState } from "../../store"; // Adjust the path to your store
import { hasPermission, MyResourceConfig } from "../access-control"; // Adjust path as needed

interface PermissionHOCProps<R extends keyof MyResourceConfig["resources"]> {
  resource: R;
  action: MyResourceConfig["resources"][R]["action"];
  data?: MyResourceConfig["resources"][R]["dataType"];
  children: ReactNode;
}

const PermissionHOC = <R extends keyof MyResourceConfig["resources"]>({
  resource,
  action,
  data,
  children,
}: PermissionHOCProps<R>) => {
  const user = useSelector((state: RootState) => state.auth.user);
  const [hasAccess, setHasAccess] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (user) {
      setHasAccess(hasPermission(user, resource, action, data));
    }
  }, [user, resource, action, data]);

  return hasAccess ? <>{children}</> : null;
};

export default PermissionHOC;
```

### Example Usage in a Component:

```typescript
import React from "react";
import PermissionHOC from "./PermissionHOC";

const TodoComponent = () => {
  return (
    <PermissionHOC resource="todos" action="read">
      <div>
        {/* This content will only be visible if the user has the "read" permission for "todos" */}
        <p>Todo List</p>
      </div>
    </PermissionHOC>
  );
};

export default TodoComponent;
```

## 2. **Permission Guard** for Route Protection

In React, we can use **React Router** along with a custom route guard to ensure that users cannot access certain routes unless they have the necessary permissions.

### Route Guard

```typescript
import React, { ReactNode, useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { Redirect, Route, RouteProps } from "react-router-dom";
import { useSelector } from "react-redux";
import { RootState } from "../../store"; // Adjust path as needed
import { hasPermission, MyResourceConfig } from "../access-control"; // Adjust path

interface ProtectedRouteProps<R extends keyof MyResourceConfig["resources"]>
  extends RouteProps {
  resource: R;
  action: MyResourceConfig["resources"][R]["action"];
  data?: MyResourceConfig["resources"][R]["dataType"];
  children: ReactNode;
}

const ProtectedRoute = <R extends keyof MyResourceConfig["resources"]>({
  resource,
  action,
  data,
  children,
  ...rest
}: ProtectedRouteProps<R>) => {
  const user = useSelector((state: RootState) => state.auth.user);
  const [hasAccess, setHasAccess] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (user) {
      setHasAccess(hasPermission(user, resource, action, data));
    }
  }, [user, resource, action, data]);

  return (
    <Route
      {...rest}
      render={({ location }) =>
        hasAccess ? (
          children
        ) : (
          <Redirect
            to={{
              pathname: "/403", // Redirect to a 403 page if no permission
              state: { from: location },
            }}
          />
        )
      }
    />
  );
};

export default ProtectedRoute;
```

### Example Usage in Routes:

```typescript
import React from "react";
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Switch } from "react-router-dom";
import ProtectedRoute from "./ProtectedRoute";
import TodoComponent from "./TodoComponent";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Switch>
        <ProtectedRoute path="/todo" resource="todos" action="read">
          <TodoComponent />
        </ProtectedRoute>
        <Route path="/403" render={() => <div>Forbidden</div>} />
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## Explanation:

- **`hasPermission` Check**: Both the **Permission HOC** and **Route Guard** rely on the `hasPermission` function from **role-baker** to check if the user has the required permission for the specified resource and action.
- **Conditional Rendering**: The **Permission HOC** ensures that only authorized content is rendered within a component. If the user doesn't have permission, the content is hidden.
- **Route Protection**: The **Route Guard** works with **React Router** to restrict access to specific routes based on user permissions. If the user doesn’t have the right permission, they are redirected to a **403 Forbidden** page.

These utilities integrate seamlessly with React to enforce role-based access control in your application.
